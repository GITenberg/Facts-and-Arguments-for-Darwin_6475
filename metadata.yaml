description: "Facts and Arguments for Darwin is an 1864 book on evolutionary biology\
  \ by the German biologist Fritz Müller, originally published in German under the\
  \ title Für Darwin (\"For Darwin\"), and translated into English by William Sweetland\
  \ Dallas in 1867. Müller argued that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural\
  \ selection that he had advanced in his book The Origin of Species only five years\
  \ earlier was correct, citing evidence that he had come across in Brazil.\nMüller\
  \ states in the 'Author's Preface':\n\n“It is not the purpose of the following pages\
  \ to discuss once more the arguments deduced for and against Darwin's theory of\
  \ the origin of species, or to weigh them one against the other. Their object is\
  \ simply to indicate a few facts favourable to this theory, collected upon the same\
  \ South American ground, on which, as Darwin tells us, the idea first occurred to\
  \ him of devoting his attention to ‘the origin of species, — that mystery of mysteries’.\n\
  \n“It is only by the accumulation of new and valuable material that the controversy\
  \ will gradually be brought into a state fit for final decision, and this appears\
  \ to be for the present of more importance than a repeated analysis of what is already\
  \ before us. Moreover, it is but fair to leave it to Darwin himself at first to\
  \ beat off the attacks of his opponents from the splendid structure which he has\
  \ raised with such a master-hand.”\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
