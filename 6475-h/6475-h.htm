      <br /><br /> <b>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</b> <br />
    </p>
    <p class="one">
      My principal reason for undertaking the translation of Dr. Fritz M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
      admirable work on the Crustacea, entitled &lsquo;F&uuml;r Darwin,&rsquo;
      was that it was still, although published as long ago as 1864, and highly
      esteemed by the author&rsquo;s scientific countrymen, absolutely unknown
      to a great number of English naturalists, including some who have occupied
      themselves more or less specially with the subjects of which it treats. It
      possesses a value quite independent of its reference to Darwinism, due to
      the number of highly interesting and important facts in the natural
      history and particularly the developmental history of the Crustacea, which
      its distinguished author, himself an unwearied and original investigator
      of these matters, has brought together in it. To a considerable section of
      English naturalists the tone adopted by the author in speaking of one of
      the greatest of their number will be a source of much gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      In granting his permission for the translation of his little book, Dr.
      Fritz M&uuml;ller kindly offered to send some emendations and additions to
      certain parts of it. His notes included many corrections of printers'
      errors, some of which would have proved unintelligible without his aid,
      some small additions and notes which have been inserted in their proper
      places, and two longer pieces, one forming a footnote near the close of
      Chapter 11, the other at the end of Chapter 12, describing the probable
      mode of evolution of the Rhizocephala from the Cirripedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the execution of the translation I will say but little. My chief object
      in this, as in other cases, has been to furnish, as nearly as possible, a
      literal version of the original, regarding mere elegance of expression as
      of secondary importance in a scientific work. As much of Dr. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s
      German does not submit itself to such treatment very readily, I must beg
      his and the reader&rsquo;s indulgence for any imperfections arising from
      this cause.

      <br /><br /> <b>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</b> <br />
    </p>
    <p class="one">
      It is not the purpose of the following pages to discuss once more the
      arguments deduced for and against Darwin&rsquo;s theory of the origin of
      species, or to weigh them one against the other. Their object is simply to
      indicate a few facts favourable to this theory, collected upon the same
      South American ground, on which, as Darwin tells us, the idea first
      occurred to him of devoting his attention to &ldquo;the origin of species,&mdash;that
      mystery of mysteries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only by the accumulation of new and valuable material that the
      controversy will gradually be brought into a state fit for final decision,
      and this appears to be for the present of more importance than a repeated
      analysis of what is already before us. Moreover, it is but fair to leave
      it to Darwin himself at first to beat off the attacks of his opponents
      from the splendid structure which he has raised with such a master-hand.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
